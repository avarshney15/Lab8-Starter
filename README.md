**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?** 

Service workers can cache things when accessed or update. If something were to fail in the system or network, the sevice worker will provide the cached version. This relates to graceful degradation, which is the idea of maintaining core functionalities when things go wrong. By serving cache content, service workers help keep the application functional.
